Python Basics:
What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

Key Features:

Simple and Readable Syntax: Python emphasizes readability and uses a clean and straightforward syntax, making it easy to learn and understand.
Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that provides support for a wide range of tasks, from web development to data processing.
Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly, making code writing faster and more flexible.
Interpreted and Interactive: Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, allowing for rapid development and testing through interactive sessions and REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
Cross-platform: Python is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly portable.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask are popular for building web applications.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are widely used for data manipulation and visualization.
Machine Learning and AI: Libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn make Python a preferred choice for machine learning and artificial intelligence projects.
Automation and Scripting: Python's simplicity and versatility make it ideal for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks and system administration.
Installing Python:
Steps to Install Python:

Download Python: Go to the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.
Run Installer: Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.
Verify Installation:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Type python --version to check the installed Python version.
Set Up Virtual Environment: Install the virtualenv package using pip and create a virtual environment for your project.
bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
Python Syntax and Semantics:
Simple Python Program:

python
Copy code
# Print "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")
Basic Syntax Elements:

print(): A built-in function used to print output to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string literal enclosed in double quotes.
Data Types and Variables:
Basic Data Types in Python:

Integer (int): Represents whole numbers, e.g., 10, -5.
Float (float): Represents floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5.
String (str): Represents text, e.g., "hello", 'world'.
Boolean (bool): Represents True or False values.
Variable Example:

python
Copy code
# Create variables of different data types
x = 10          # integer
y = 3.14        # float
name = "Alice"  # string
is_valid = True # boolean

# Print variable values
print(x, y, name, is_valid)
Control Structures:
Conditional Statements:

python
Copy code
# If-else statement
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Non-positive")
Loops:

python
Copy code
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
Functions in Python:
Functions:
Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in modularizing code, improving code reusability, and enhancing readability.

Example Function:

python
Copy code
# Function to calculate sum of two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Call the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)
Lists and Dictionaries:
Lists vs. Dictionaries:

Lists (list): Ordered collection of items, accessed by index.
Dictionaries (dict): Unordered collection of key-value pairs, accessed by key.
Example Script:

python
Copy code
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary of key-value pairs
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Accessing elements
print("First number:", numbers[0])
print("Person's age:", person["age"])

# Adding elements
numbers.append(6)
person["gender"] = "Female"

# Removing elements
numbers.remove(3)
del person["city"]
Exception Handling:
Exception Handling:
Exception handling in Python allows for graceful handling of errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution.
